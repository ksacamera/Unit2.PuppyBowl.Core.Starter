# PuppyBowl

Welcome to PuppyBowl!

## Getting Started

1. Launch `index.html`. The website should be blank!
2. Read through the comments of each function in `script.js` to get a sense of what this website should do once completed.

## Instructions

Finish writing the code for each function according to the comments. You should replace each comment marked `//TODO` with your own code in order to make the app functional.
